          <p>I received my associates degree in Nursing from Georgia Piedmont Technical College in 2009, and a bachelors degree in Science from Clayton State University in 2011. I received my master's degree from Devry University in Information Systems minor Project Management in 2015. I currently work at a Chidren's Hospital in Atlanta as a Nurse Case Manager and have been there for 13 years. My goal is to transition into the field of Information Systems and work as a Software Developer.</p>
